This is the xattr-util binary from Mike Bombich's version of Backup Bouncer
(http://www.bombich.com/groups/ccc/wiki/7ba51/). The following is a quote from
that page:

“I replaced xattr-util altogether. I encountered too many crashes on various
platforms that I decided replacing it with a known-good alternative was probably
a better way to go. The attached binary is a 32-bit Universal binary that is
compatible with Tiger, Leopard, and Snow Leopard. It exposes the HFS+
compression extended attributes by default, making it easier to validate files
that should retain those attributes.”
